        WeBuyPhones was started in 2016 when we realized the need for a safe and secure way of
        selling your unwanted phone. The tech industry has boomed in the last 6 years, and with it
        came the secondhand market. The second-hand phone market is valued at over R1 billion rand.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This is an appealing number for tech lovers and scammers alike. Tech lovers could now trade
        their phones easily with huge demand for second-hand goods. But this also opened the door
        for all sorts of scams. Even seasoned tech traders aren't safe in this elaborate plot of
        scams.
